    <h1>What is MERN Application</h1>
    <p>
    MERN Stack is a compilation of four different technologies that work together to develop dynamic web apps and websites. 

It is a contraction for four different technologies as mentioned below:

M - MongoDB
E - ExpressJS
R - ReactJS
N - NodeJS
Considering youâ€™ve downloaded and configured all the four aforementioned technologies, you need to know how to create a new project folder to get started with the MERN stack. Next, you need to open the folder on the CMD (or terminal) and enter the following command to initialize a package.json file:

npm init

    </p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
